Description:
	This program implements a version of Dijkstra's Algorithm to
	solve a predefined maze with the shortest possible 

Program files:
	- main.cpp
	- maze.cpp
	- maze.h
	- binary-maze.txt

Other files:
	- README.txt
	- blockwise-maze-jamis-buck-labeled.jpg

Possible future amendments:
	1) Create a program to automatically generate mazes with user
	defined size.
	2) Modify command prompt output to look cleaner by importing
	Unicode characters to print.
